<p>Over the summer between my bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degrees, I made a documentary about a fascinating two years in the history of UC San Diego. The inspiration for this was learning that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_UC_San_Diego_Tritons_football_team">UCSD had a football team for a single season</a>, in 1968, but as I dug into the <a href="https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/collection/bb4847930p">Triton Times (now the Guardian) archives</a> from the era, I found that football was just one of a series of fascinating things happening on the UCSD campus. From Reagan to Angela Davis to Herbert Marcuse to Lumumba-Zapata to a broken glass door, the infant university was anything but dull in its early years. And we never talk about it.</p>

<p>After releasing the documentary, <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/story/2022-10-16/ucsd-football-documentary">I was featured on the front page of the San Diego Union-Tribune</a>, in an article by Gary Robbins about my documentary. In addition, I was honored to receive second prize in the Feature Reporting category for College TV/Online Video at the San Diego Press Club Awards.</p>
