<p>Over the summer between my bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs degrees, I made a documentary about a fascinating two years in the history of UC San Diego. The inspiration for this was learning that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_UC_San_Diego_Tritons_football_team">UCSD had a football team for a single season</a>, in 1968, but as I dug into the <a href="https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/collection/bb4847930p">Triton Times (now the Guardian) archives</a> from the era, I found that football was just one of a series of fascinating things happening on the UCSD campus. From Reagan to Angela Davis to Herbert Marcuse to Lumumba-Zapata to a broken glass door, the infant university was anything but dull in its early years. And we never talk about it.</p>

<p>After releasing the documentary, <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/story/2022-10-16/ucsd-football-documentary">I was featured on the front page of the San Diego Union-Tribune</a>, in an article by Gary Robbins about my documentary. In addition, I was honored to receive second prize in the Feature Reporting category for College TV/Online Video at the San Diego Press Club Awards.</p>

<h2 id="nextprof-pathfinder-2023">NextProf Pathfinder 2023</h2>

<p>I was extremely lucky to be invited to the <a href="https://nextprofpathfinder.engin.umich.edu/">2023 NextProf Pathfinder Workshop</a>, hosted by the University of Michigan, and co-sponsored by UC San Diego‚Äôs Jacobs School of Engineering and Georgia Tech‚Äôs College of Engineering. At the three-day workshop, I had the chance to meet dozens of like-minded master‚Äôs and PhD students in engineering from around the country, and learn more about the steps I can take towards my eventual goals of a faculty position.</p>

<p>This is besides the point, but I also had a great time walking around Ann Arbor, including the best sandwich I‚Äôve had in years at Zingerman‚Äôs. (It almost made me forget that my hands were so cold I couldn‚Äôt move them very fast.)</p>
