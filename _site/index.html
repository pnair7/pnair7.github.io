<p><strong><em>I‚Äôm currently applying for PhD programs in and around computer science for Fall 2024 admission!</em></strong></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>I‚Äôm currently advised by <a href="https://www.daviddanks.org/">Professor David Danks</a> of the Halƒ±cƒ±oƒülu Data Science Institute (HDSI) and Department of Philosophy at UCSD.</strong> My thesis research deals with using active learning in fairness-sensitive decisions that suffer from unobserved counterfactuals, establishing how decisionmakers can benefit epistemically in the long run by observing points that were historically unlikely to be observed. I‚Äôm also currently a teaching assistant in HDSI, supervising the senior capstone course.</p>

<p>Prior to my graduate study, I was a data science major at UC San Diego üî±, graduating with minors in history and liguistics, and a concentration in political science. They wouldn‚Äôt let me triple minor.</p>

<p>Outside the classroom, I was the sports editor of <a href="https://ucsdguardian.org">The UCSD Guardian</a>, I was (and continue to be) in UCSD‚Äôs quizbowl club, and I spent a summer making a documentary about UCSD‚Äôs history. In my free time, I‚Äôm watching as many sports as I can, reading books at a glacial pace, and reading Wikipedia pages.</p>

<h4 id="specifically-that-includes">Specifically, that includes:</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Machine learning fairness:</strong> how can we ensure algorithms make decisions that match our philosophical notions of fairness? What <em>is</em> fair, anyway?
    <ul>
      <li>Can we develop guidelines for algorithmic systems that are fair <em>from end to end</em>, from data collection to, ultimately, taking action?</li>
      <li>How do factors like temporal dynamics,  missingness, or other complications affect how we assess fairness?</li>
      <li>How can researchers and regulators detect unfairness in the wild?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Human-AI interaction</strong>: How do people make sense of and react to algorithmic decisionmaking that affects their lives? How do recent publicly released models affect the relationship between users and ML?</p>
  </li>
  <li>‚Ä¶and plenty of other areas where people meet algorithms, such as interpretability, policy, algorithmic auditing, and participatory design.</li>
</ul>
