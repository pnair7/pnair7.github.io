  <h3>üëã Hey, I'm Praveen! I just finished my master's degree in Computer Science at UC San Diego, researching the responsible use of algorithms in society and causal discovery.</h3>

<p><em>prnair@ucsd.edu</em> ‚Ä¢ <a href="/assets/CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8OTteiYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://github.com/pnair7" target="_blank">GitHub</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pnair7/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>

<p>I was advised by <a href="https://www.daviddanks.org/" target="_blank">Professor David Danks</a> of the Halƒ±cƒ±oƒülu Data Science Institute (HDSI) and Department of Philosophy at UCSD, with whom I have continued to work on a couple projects. My thesis research deals with using causal inference and active learning in fairness-sensitive decisions where outcomes are not always observed, establishing how even without active bias or flawed models, imbalances in group size can lead to differences in uncertainty. I was also a teaching assistant in HDSI, supervising the <a href="https://dsc-capstone.org/" target="_blank">senior capstone course</a> and <a href="https://dsc80.com/" target="_blank">DSC 80</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to my graduate study, I was a data science major at UC San Diego üî±, graduating with minors in history and liguistics, and a concentration in political science. (They wouldn‚Äôt let me triple minor.)</p>

<p>Outside the classroom, I was the sports editor of <a href="https://ucsdguardian.org" target="_blank">The UCSD Guardian</a>, was in UCSD‚Äôs quizbowl club, and spent a summer making <a href="https://pnair7.github.io/fun">a documentary about UCSD‚Äôs history</a>. In my free time, I‚Äôm watching as many sports as I can, reading Wikipedia pages, and watching movies.</p>

<h2 id="-research-interests">üßë‚Äçüíª Research Interests</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Responsible ML:</strong> How do we build decisionmaking systems around algorithms that uphold our values and lead to the outcomes we want? How can researchers and regulators detect unfairness in the wild?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Causal inference</strong>: How can we use statistical methods to develop causal notions for discovery? Can the abstractions of causation give us the tools to develop more responsible ML systems?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Interpretability</strong>: Can humans gain a working understanding of complex models? Do we need to in order to use them?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
