  <h3>Hi, I'm Praveen! I'm a second-year master's student in Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego, researching machine learning fairness and the responsible use of algorithms in society.</h3>

<hr />

<p>I’m currently advised by <a href="https://www.daviddanks.org/">Professor David Danks</a> of the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute and Department of Philosophy at UCSD. <strong>I’m currently applying for PhD programs in computer science (and adjacent areas) for Fall 2024 admission!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Currently, my research interests include:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Machine learning fairness:</strong> how can we convert philosophical notions of fairness to assessments of algorithms? How can we resolve conflicts in either?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Human-AI interaction</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>My thesis research deals with <strong>using active learning in fairness-sensitive decisions that suffer from unobserved counterfactuals</strong>, establishing how decisionmakers can benefit epistemically in the long run by observing points that were historically unlikely to be observed.</p>

<p>Prior to my graduate study, I was a data science major at UC San Diego, graduating with minors in history and liguistics, and a concentration in political science. (They wouldn’t let me triple minor.) Outside the classroom, I was the sports editor of The UCSD Guardian, I was (and continue to be) in UCSD’s quizbowl club, and I spent a summer making a documentary about UCSD’s history.</p>

<h2 id="️-teaching">✏️ Teaching</h2>

<p>I’ve been a teaching assistant in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute for every quarter as a graduate student at UCSD. As a teaching assistant for <strong>DSC 180, the data science senior capstone sequence</strong> (Fall 2022, Winter 2023, <a href="https://dsc-capstone.org/">Fall 2023, Winter 2024</a>), I’ve advised and evaluated groups of students as they worked with faculty and industry mentors in a two-quarter project sequence.</p>

<p>As the lead TA for <strong>DSC 80, Practice and Application of Data Science</strong>, I led discussions of 80 to 100 students by myself with live coding, held <em>very</em> busy office hours, and graded assignments. In teaching evaluations,</p>
