  <h3>üëã Hey, I'm Praveen! I'm an incoming Computer Science PhD student at Brown University, and I'm interested in the responsible use of algorithms in society, causality, and computational social science.</h3>

<p><em>praveen_nair@brown.edu</em> ‚Ä¢ <a href="/assets/CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8OTteiYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://github.com/pnair7" target="_blank">GitHub</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pnair7/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>

<p>At Brown, I‚Äôll be working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z03FLwkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Professor Suresh Venkatasubramanian</a> at the <a href="https://cntr.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Technological Responsibility, Reimagination, and Redesign (CNTR)</a>.</p>

<p>As an RA with <a href="https://www.amitgoldenberg.com/" target="_blank">Professor Amit Goldenberg</a> at Harvard Business School, I contributed to a number of projects dealing with AI and emotional support. This included the implementation, management, and analysis of an interactive study on GPT vs. human performance in cognitive reappraisal tasks (<a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/fzvd8_v3" target="_blank">preprint here</a>).</p>

<p>In 2024, I graduated from UC San Diego üî± with a master‚Äôs in computer science, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.daviddanks.org/" target="_blank">Professor David Danks</a>. <a href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt2hm001k0/qt2hm001k0_noSplash_9acadb652ecaf8978f23cdf68974847f.pdf" target="_blank">My thesis</a> uses causal inference and active learning to study fairness-sensitive decisions with selective labeling, establishing how even without biased or flawed models, imbalances in group size can lead to differences in uncertainty.</p>

<p>At UCSD, I was also a teaching assistant supervising the <a href="https://dsc-capstone.org/" target="_blank">data science capstone course</a> and <a href="https://dsc80.com/" target="_blank">DSC 80</a>. Prior to my graduate study, I was a data science major at UC San Diego, graduating with minors in history and liguistics, and a concentration in political science. Outside the classroom, I was the sports editor of <a href="https://ucsdguardian.org" target="_blank">The UCSD Guardian</a>, was in UCSD‚Äôs quizbowl club, and spent a summer making <a href="https://pnair7.github.io/fun">a documentary about UCSD‚Äôs history</a>. In my free time, I‚Äôm watching a lot of sports, reading Wikipedia pages, and watching movies.</p>

<h2 id="-research-interests">üßë‚Äçüíª Research Interests</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Responsible ML:</strong> How do we build decisionmaking systems around algorithms that uphold our values and lead to the outcomes we want? How can researchers and regulators detect unfairness in the wild?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Causal inference</strong>: How can we use statistical methods to develop causal notions for discovery? Can the abstractions of causation give us the tools to develop more responsible ML systems?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Human-AI Interaction</strong>: How do the ways in which humans perceive and react to algorithmic systems affect the way in which we should design them?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
