<p><em>March 2023 ‚Äî Present</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Main project:</strong> In many common fairness settings, we can‚Äôt observe counterfactuals ‚Äî e.g. would a person we denied a loan pay it back if we had granted it? ‚Äî and this biases training data, creating uncertainty particularly for groups historically denied loans.</li>
  <li>Using techniques like <strong><a href="https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/seminars/rsem/">structural equation modeling</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infomax">infomax active learning</a></strong>, we seek to formalize whether getting labels (say, granting loans) for underrepresented groups or areas of our feature space for informational purposes could improve our model faster. This presents an explore-exploit tradeoff common in sequential decision problems, where we must balance doing what our model currently recommends with acquiring better training data.</li>
  <li>Technically, using <a href="https://ecmerkle.github.io/blavaan/">blavaan</a> for Bayesian latent-variable modeling, and formulated  likelihood function for our version of SEM</li>
  <li><strong>Also:</strong> establishing forward inference problem and running simulations for <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2008/hash/37bc2f75bf1bcfe8450a1a41c200364c-Abstract.html">integration of overlapping networks</a> problem in collaboration with the <a href="https://trendscenter.org/">TReNDS Center</a></li>

<p><em>June 2021 ‚Äî June 2022</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Interned at the <a href="https://www.stowerslab.com/">Stowers Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/">Scripps Research Institute</a> under, providing computational assistance for neuroscience projects studying behavior</li>
  <li>Used ML tools such as <a href="https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/README.html">DeepLabCut</a> and <a href="https://github.com/YttriLab/B-SOID">B-SOID</a> on remote compute cluster, extracting pose information from mouse behavior video</li>
  <li>Performed timeseries manipulation and analysis</li>
  <li>Worked on projects studying neurological underpinnings of physiological arousal, mouse scent marking, and olfaction</li>

<h2 id="research-intern-uc-san-diego-computer-science-and-engineering">Research Intern, UC San Diego Computer Science and Engineering</h2>
<p><em>June 2021 ‚Äî December 2021</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Under <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/alvarado/">Professor Christine Alvarado</a>, studied the effects of <a href="https://ersp.eng.ucsd.edu/">ERSP</a>, an early-undergraduate CS research program, on students‚Äô senses of identity as researchers and computer scientists</li>
  <li>Used thematic analysis methods on open-ended survey data, as well as Python for preprocessing, analysis, and interrater reliability calculation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="qualcomm-institute-learning-academy">Qualcomm Institute Learning Academy</h2>
<p><em>September 2020 ‚Äî December 2021</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Along with another undergraduate, supervised by <a href="https://bouve.northeastern.edu/directory/leanne-chukoskie/">Leanne Chukoskie</a> at the Qualcomm Institute at UCSD, conducted self-directed research project on engagement in online learning during COVID pandemic</li>
  <li>Developed and distributed survey of UCSD students about their course experiences</li>
  <li>Analyzed and visualized data in R, wrote most of paper‚Äôs Results section</li>
  <li><strong>Published in <em>Frontiers in Education</em> as co-first author</strong></li>
