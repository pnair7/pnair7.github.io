Over the summer between my bachelor's and master's degrees, I made a documentary about a fascinating two years in the history of UC San Diego. The inspiration for this was learning that [UCSD had a football team for a single season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_UC_San_Diego_Tritons_football_team), in 1968, but as I dug into the [Triton Times (now the Guardian) archives](https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/collection/bb4847930p) from the era, I found that football was just one of a series of fascinating things happening on the UCSD campus. From Reagan to Angela Davis to Herbert Marcuse to Lumumba-Zapata to a broken glass door, the infant university was anything but dull in its early years. And we never talk about it.

After releasing the documentary, [I was featured on the front page of the San Diego Union-Tribune](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/story/2022-10-16/ucsd-football-documentary), in an article by Gary Robbins about my documentary. In addition, I was honored to receive second prize in the Feature Reporting category for College TV/Online Video at the San Diego Press Club Awards.
