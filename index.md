I'm currently advised by [Professor David Danks](https://www.daviddanks.org/) of the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute and Department of Philosophy at UCSD. **I'm currently applying for PhD programs in computer science (and adjacent areas) for Fall 2024 admission!**

**Currently, my research interests include:**

* **Machine learning fairness:** how can we convert philosophical notions of fairness to assessments of algorithms? How can we resolve conflicts in either?

* **Human-AI interaction**

My thesis research deals with **using active learning in fairness-sensitive decisions that suffer from unobserved counterfactuals**, establishing how decisionmakers can benefit epistemically in the long run by observing points that were historically unlikely to be observed.

Prior to my graduate study, I was a data science major at UC San Diego, graduating with minors in history and liguistics, and a concentration in political science. (They wouldn't let me triple minor.) Outside the classroom, I was the sports editor of The UCSD Guardian, I was (and continue to be) in UCSD's quizbowl club, and I spent a summer making a documentary about UCSD's history.

## ✏️ Teaching

I've been a teaching assistant in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute for every quarter as a graduate student at UCSD. As a teaching assistant for **DSC 180, the data science senior capstone sequence** (Fall 2022, Winter 2023, [Fall 2023, Winter 2024](https://dsc-capstone.org/)), I've advised and evaluated groups of students as they worked with faculty and industry mentors in a two-quarter project sequence. 

As the lead TA for **DSC 80, Practice and Application of Data Science**, I led discussions of 80 to 100 students by myself with live coding, held *very* busy office hours, and graded assignments. In teaching evaluations,
