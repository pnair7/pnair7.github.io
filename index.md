At Brown, I'll be working with [Professor Suresh Venkatasubramanian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z03FLwkAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} at the [Center for Technological Responsibility, Reimagination, and Redesign (CNTR)](https://cntr.brown.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

As an RA with [Professor Amit Goldenberg](https://www.amitgoldenberg.com/){:target="_blank"} at Harvard Business School, I contributed to a number of projects dealing with AI and emotional support. This included the implementation, management, and analysis of an interactive study on GPT vs. human performance in cognitive reappraisal tasks ([preprint here](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/fzvd8_v3){:target="_blank"}).

In 2024, I graduated from UC San Diego üî± with a master's in computer science, where I was advised by [Professor David Danks](https://www.daviddanks.org/){:target="_blank"}. [My thesis](https://escholarship.org/content/qt2hm001k0/qt2hm001k0_noSplash_9acadb652ecaf8978f23cdf68974847f.pdf){:target="_blank"} uses causal inference and active learning to study fairness-sensitive decisions with selective labeling, establishing how even without biased or flawed models, imbalances in group size can lead to differences in uncertainty. 

At UCSD, I was also a teaching assistant supervising the [data science capstone course](https://dsc-capstone.org/){:target="_blank"} and [DSC 80](https://dsc80.com/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to my graduate study, I was a data science major at UC San Diego, graduating with minors in history and liguistics, and a concentration in political science. Outside the classroom, I was the sports editor of [The UCSD Guardian](https://ucsdguardian.org){:target="_blank"}, was in UCSD's quizbowl club, and spent a summer making [a documentary about UCSD's history](https://pnair7.github.io/fun). In my free time, I'm watching a lot of sports, reading Wikipedia pages, and watching movies.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Research Interests

* **Responsible ML:** How do we build decisionmaking systems around algorithms that uphold our values and lead to the outcomes we want? How can researchers and regulators detect unfairness in the wild?

* **Causal inference**: How can we use statistical methods to develop causal notions for discovery? Can the abstractions of causation give us the tools to develop more responsible ML systems?

* **Human-AI Interaction**: How do the ways in which humans perceive and react to algorithmic systems affect the way in which we should design them?
