I was advised by [Professor David Danks](https://www.daviddanks.org/){:target="_blank"} of the Halƒ±cƒ±oƒülu Data Science Institute (HDSI) and Department of Philosophy at UCSD, with whom I have continued to work on a couple projects. My thesis research deals with using causal inference and active learning in fairness-sensitive decisions where outcomes are not always observed, establishing how even without active bias or flawed models, imbalances in group size can lead to differences in uncertainty. I was also a teaching assistant in HDSI, supervising the [senior capstone course](https://dsc-capstone.org/){:target="_blank"} and [DSC 80](https://dsc80.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Prior to my graduate study, I was a data science major at UC San Diego üî±, graduating with minors in history and liguistics, and a concentration in political science. (They wouldn't let me triple minor.)

Outside the classroom, I was the sports editor of [The UCSD Guardian](https://ucsdguardian.org){:target="_blank"}, was in UCSD's quizbowl club, and spent a summer making [a documentary about UCSD's history](https://pnair7.github.io/fun). In my free time, I'm watching as many sports as I can, reading Wikipedia pages, and watching movies.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Research Interests

### If and when we use algorithms to make important social decisions, what will go wrong, and how can we find out?

#### Specifically, that includes:

* **Machine learning fairness:** how can we ensure algorithms make decisions that match our philosophical notions of fairness? What *is* fair, anyway?
  * Can we develop guidelines for algorithmic systems that are fair *from end to end*, from data collection to, ultimately, taking action?
  * How do factors like temporal dynamics,  missingness, or other complications affect how we assess fairness?
  * How can researchers and regulators detect unfairness in the wild?

* **Human-AI interaction**: How do people make sense of and react to algorithmic decisionmaking that affects their lives? How do recent publicly released models affect the relationship between users and ML?

* ...and plenty of other areas where people meet algorithms, such as interpretability, policy, algorithmic auditing, and participatory design.
