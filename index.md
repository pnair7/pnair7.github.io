***I'm currently applying for PhD programs in and around computer science for Fall 2024 admission!***

---

**I'm currently advised by [Professor David Danks](https://www.daviddanks.org/) of the Halƒ±cƒ±oƒülu Data Science Institute (HDSI) and Department of Philosophy at UCSD.** My thesis research deals with using active learning in fairness-sensitive decisions that suffer from unobserved counterfactuals, establishing how decisionmakers can benefit epistemically in the long run by observing points that were historically unlikely to be observed. I'm also currently a teaching assistant in HDSI, supervising the senior capstone course.

Prior to my graduate study, I was a data science major at UC San Diego üî±, graduating with minors in history and liguistics, and a concentration in political science. They wouldn't let me triple minor.

Outside the classroom, I was the sports editor of [The UCSD Guardian](https://ucsdguardian.org), I was (and continue to be) in UCSD's quizbowl club, and I spent a summer making a documentary about UCSD's history. In my free time, I'm watching as many sports as I can, reading books at a glacial pace, and reading Wikipedia pages.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Research Interests

### If and when we use algorithms to make important social decisions, what will go wrong, and how can we find out?

#### Specifically, that includes:

* **Machine learning fairness:** how can we ensure algorithms make decisions that match our philosophical notions of fairness? What *is* fair, anyway?
  * Can we develop guidelines for algorithmic systems that are fair *from end to end*, from data collection to, ultimately, taking action?
  * How do factors like temporal dynamics,  missingness, or other complications affect how we assess fairness?
  * How can researchers and regulators detect unfairness in the wild?

* **Human-AI interaction**: How do people make sense of and react to algorithmic decisionmaking that affects their lives? How do recent publicly released models affect the relationship between users and ML?

* ...and plenty of other areas where people meet algorithms, such as interpretability, policy, algorithmic auditing, and participatory design.
