I was advised by [Professor David Danks](https://www.daviddanks.org/){:target="_blank"} of the Halƒ±cƒ±oƒülu Data Science Institute (HDSI) and Department of Philosophy at UCSD, with whom I have continued to work on a couple projects. My thesis research deals with using causal inference and active learning in fairness-sensitive decisions where outcomes are not always observed, establishing how even without active bias or flawed models, imbalances in group size can lead to differences in uncertainty. I was also a teaching assistant in HDSI, supervising the [senior capstone course](https://dsc-capstone.org/){:target="_blank"} and [DSC 80](https://dsc80.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Prior to my graduate study, I was a data science major at UC San Diego üî±, graduating with minors in history and liguistics, and a concentration in political science. (They wouldn't let me triple minor.)

Outside the classroom, I was the sports editor of [The UCSD Guardian](https://ucsdguardian.org){:target="_blank"}, was in UCSD's quizbowl club, and spent a summer making [a documentary about UCSD's history](https://pnair7.github.io/fun). In my free time, I'm watching as many sports as I can, reading Wikipedia pages, and watching movies.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Research Interests

* **Responsible ML:** How do we build decisionmaking systems around algorithms that uphold our values and lead to the outcomes we want? How can researchers and regulators detect unfairness in the wild?

* **Causal inference**: How can we use statistical methods to develop causal notions for discovery? Can the abstractions of causation give us the tools to develop more responsible ML systems?

* **Interpretability**: Can humans gain a working understanding of complex models? Do we need to in order to use them?
