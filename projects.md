### Patterns of Fairness in Machine Learning

This was my data science senior capstone project, in which two other students and I, under the supervision of [Professor David Danks](https://www.daviddanks.org){:target="_blank"}, looked at how different classifiers performed on multiple canonical fairness datasets, for a series of different metrics of algorithmic fairness. The project was designed to be user-extensible to new datasets and metrics. The GitHub repo for our project is [here](https://github.com/pnair7/ml-fairness){:target="_blank"}, and the report for the project is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pnair7/artifact-directory-template/main/report.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

### Logistic Regression Penalizing Demographic Disparities

Final project for CSE 203B, Convex Optimization, at UCSD. Extended work from [Bechavod and Ligett (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00044){:target="_blank"} to develop additional fairness penalizers in optimization formulation of logistic regression. Derived dual formulation and solved with [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/){:target="_blank"}. Also, the first time I ever typeset a bunch of math in LaTeX, which isn't an achievement, but it sure felt like it. Report available [here](/assets/CSE_203B_Project.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
