## Research Associate, [Digital Emotions Lab](https://www.amitgoldenberg.com/){:target="_blank"}, Harvard Business School
*January 2025 - Present*

- Studying human-AI interaction in emotional regulation tasks, using experimental and machine learning methods
- Building platform for human-AI trials, and developing pilot and large-scale studies
- Supporting lab's computational, data, and informational infrastructure

## Integration of Overlapping Networks via Constrains (ION-C)
*September 2023 - Present*

- Lead author on paper introducing constraint-solving approach to [integration of overlapping networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2008/hash/37bc2f75bf1bcfe8450a1a41c200364c-Abstract.html){:target="_blank"} problem with applications in neuroscience and social science, in collaboration with the [TReNDS Center](https://trendscenter.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Professor Sergey Plis](https://trendscenter.org/sergey-plis/){:target="_blank"}
- Running simulations on compute clusters with Kubernetes and Slurm, using [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/){:target="_blank"} to solve answer-set programming formulation, establishing use on empirical data, and implementing causal learning methods to optimize inputs
- Paper in submission, **[currently on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04243){:target="_blank"}**


## Active Learning and Epistemic Defenses of Fairness
*March 2023 ‚Äî Present*

- **[Finished thesis available here](https://escholarship.org/content/qt2hm001k0/qt2hm001k0_noSplash_9acadb652ecaf8978f23cdf68974847f.pdf){:target="_blank"}**
- In many common fairness settings, we can‚Äôt observe counterfactuals ‚Äî e.g. would a person we denied a loan pay it back if we had granted it? ‚Äî and this biases training data, creating uncertainty particularly for groups historically denied loans. Using techniques like **[structural equation modeling](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/seminars/rsem/){:target="_blank"} and [infomax active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infomax){:target="_blank"}**, we show how in these situations even with optimal, unbiased models, differences in true group parameters can lead to large differences in uncertainty. 
- Technically, using [blavaan](https://ecmerkle.github.io/blavaan/){:target="_blank"} for Bayesian latent-variable modeling, and formulated a maximum-likelihood problem to find points with greatest informational value

## Computational Research Intern, Scripps Research 
*June 2021 ‚Äî June 2022*

- Interned at the [Stowers Lab](https://www.stowerslab.com/){:target="_blank"} at the [Scripps Research Institute](https://www.scripps.edu/){:target="_blank"} under, providing computational assistance for neuroscience projects studying behavior
- Used ML tools such as [DeepLabCut](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/README.html){:target="_blank"} and [B-SOID](https://github.com/YttriLab/B-SOID){:target="_blank"} on remote compute cluster, extracting pose information from mouse behavior video
- Performed timeseries manipulation and analysis
- Worked on projects studying neurological underpinnings of physiological arousal, mouse scent marking, and olfaction

## Research Intern, UC San Diego Computer Science and Engineering
*June 2021 ‚Äî December 2021*

- Under [Professor Christine Alvarado](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/alvarado/home){:target="_blank"}, studied the effects of [ERSP](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/ersp/home){:target="_blank"}, an early-undergraduate CS research program, on students' senses of identity as researchers and computer scientists
- Used thematic analysis methods on open-ended survey data, as well as Python for preprocessing, analysis, and interrater reliability calculation

## Qualcomm Institute Learning Academy
*September 2020 ‚Äî December 2021*

- Along with another undergraduate, supervised by [Leanne Chukoskie](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/directory/leanne-chukoskie/){:target="_blank"} at the Qualcomm Institute at UCSD, conducted self-directed research project on engagement in online learning during COVID pandemic
- Developed and distributed survey of UCSD students about their course experiences
- Analyzed and visualized data in R, wrote most of paper's Results section
- **Published in *Frontiers in Education* as co-first author**
