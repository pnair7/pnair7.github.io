- Main project: 

## Computational Research Intern, Scripps Research 
*June 2021 — June 2022*

- Interned at the [Stowers Lab](https://www.stowerslab.com/) at the [Scripps Research Institute](https://www.scripps.edu/) under, providing computational assistance for neuroscience projects studying behavior
- Used ML tools such as [DeepLabCut](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/README.html) and [B-SOID](https://github.com/YttriLab/B-SOID) on remote compute cluster, extracting pose information from mouse behavior video
- Performed timeseries manipulation and analysis
- Worked on projects studying neurological underpinnings of physiological arousal, mouse scent marking, and olfaction

## Research Intern, UC San Diego Computer Science and Engineering
*June 2021 — December 2021*

- Under [Professor Christine Alvarado](https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/alvarado/), studied the effects of [ERSP](https://ersp.eng.ucsd.edu/), an early-undergraduate CS research program, on students' senses of identity as researchers and computer scientists
- Used thematic analysis methods on open-ended survey data, as well as Python for preprocessing, analysis, and interrater reliability calculation

## Qualcomm Institute Learning Academy
*September 2020 — December 2021*

- Along with another undergraduate, conducted self-directed research project on engagement in online learning during COVID pandemic
- Developed and distributed survey of UCSD students about their course experiences
- Analyzed and visualized data in R, wrote most of paper's Results section
- **Published in *Frontiers in Education* as co-first author**
