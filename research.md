## Master's Thesis Research
*March 2023 ‚Äî Present*

- **Main project:** In many common fairness settings, we can‚Äôt observe counterfactuals ‚Äî e.g. would a person we denied a loan pay it back if we had granted it? ‚Äî and this biases training data, creating uncertainty particularly for groups historically denied loans. 
- Using techniques like **[structural equation modeling](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/seminars/rsem/) and [infomax active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infomax)**, we seek to formalize whether getting labels (say, granting loans) for underrepresented groups or areas of our feature space for informational purposes could improve our model faster. This presents an explore-exploit tradeoff common in sequential decision problems, where we must balance doing what our model currently recommends with acquiring better training data.
- Technically, using [blavaan](https://ecmerkle.github.io/blavaan/) for Bayesian latent-variable modeling, and formulated  likelihood function for our version of SEM
- **Also:** establishing forward inference problem and running simulations for [integration of overlapping networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2008/hash/37bc2f75bf1bcfe8450a1a41c200364c-Abstract.html) problem in collaboration with the [TReNDS Center](https://trendscenter.org/)

## Computational Research Intern, Scripps Research 
*June 2021 ‚Äî June 2022*

- Interned at the [Stowers Lab](https://www.stowerslab.com/) at the [Scripps Research Institute](https://www.scripps.edu/) under, providing computational assistance for neuroscience projects studying behavior
- Used ML tools such as [DeepLabCut](https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/README.html) and [B-SOID](https://github.com/YttriLab/B-SOID) on remote compute cluster, extracting pose information from mouse behavior video
- Performed timeseries manipulation and analysis
- Worked on projects studying neurological underpinnings of physiological arousal, mouse scent marking, and olfaction

## Research Intern, UC San Diego Computer Science and Engineering
*June 2021 ‚Äî December 2021*

- Under [Professor Christine Alvarado](https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/alvarado/), studied the effects of [ERSP](https://ersp.eng.ucsd.edu/), an early-undergraduate CS research program, on students' senses of identity as researchers and computer scientists
- Used thematic analysis methods on open-ended survey data, as well as Python for preprocessing, analysis, and interrater reliability calculation

## Qualcomm Institute Learning Academy
*September 2020 ‚Äî December 2021*

- Along with another undergraduate, supervised by [Leanne Chukoskie](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/directory/leanne-chukoskie/) at the Qualcomm Institute at UCSD, conducted self-directed research project on engagement in online learning during COVID pandemic
- Developed and distributed survey of UCSD students about their course experiences
- Analyzed and visualized data in R, wrote most of paper's Results section
- **Published in *Frontiers in Education* as co-first author**
